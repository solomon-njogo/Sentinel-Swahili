# Data Pipeline Dependencies
# Core libraries for data processing and analysis

# Note: Standard library modules used:
# - os, re, json, logging, collections, typing, datetime, argparse
# These are all part of Python's standard library, no external dependencies required.

# Text Cleaning Dependencies
# NLTK is optional - the system will use fallback implementations if NLTK is not available
nltk>=3.8  # Natural Language Toolkit (optional, for enhanced stop-word and stemming support)

# Note: After installing NLTK, you may need to download stopwords data:
# python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords')"
# However, the system works without NLTK using custom Swahili stop-word lists and stemmers.

# Dataset Structuring Dependencies
numpy>=1.23.0  # Required for feature-target split and numerical operations

# Optional dependencies for future enhancements:
# pandas>=1.5.0  # For advanced data manipulation (if needed)
# matplotlib>=3.6.0  # For visualizations (if needed)
